## Approach
I created a class in a nodejs file with methods for all of the above operations

## Approach & Efficiency
I took an approach that takes both linked lists and combines them into a third output list. I know this sacrifices space efficiency but I couldn't work out the solution to do it in place.

## Solution
call zipList(list1, list2)
